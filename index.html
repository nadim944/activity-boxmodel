    <P>Meet <em>Dexter Morgan</em>. By day he's a blood spatter pattern expert for the Miami Metro police department. But by night - he takes on an entirely different persona: serial killer. But <em>Dexter</em> isn't your average serial killer as he only kills people who fit a very prolific and precise "moral code" taught to him by his late father<em> Harry</em>, and developed very thoroughly throughout each kill. </P>

        <P>While dealing with his daily activities and his boss, <em>Sgt. Doakes</em>, the one man who may or may not know the truth about his after-hours activities, he is given a friendly message by a guy referred to only as <em>"The Ice Truck Killer"</em> - a crime scene where there is no blood. This shocking discovery turns <em>Dexter's</em> world completely upside down. <em>The Ice Truck Killer</em> wants <em>Dexter</em> to play his game and <em>Dexter</em> is very eager to take on this cat-and-mouse chase throughout Miami. </P>
